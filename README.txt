A platform for managing nutrition and fitness coaching programs. Recommend using it in conjunction with the Paid Memberships Pro plugin and the PMPro Seuqences plugin.

== Description ==
The plugin is designed to coach clients through various change processes, whether they're behavioral, nutritional, fitness related, or otherwise.

We developed the plugin to meet our own specific coaching platform needs which revolved around a year long nutrition coaching approach.
During its development, we discovered a side-benefit which also allows us to manage an online personal training membership.
