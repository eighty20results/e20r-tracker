BUG FIX: Loop because we didn't deactivate save_post and post_updated action before calling wp_update_post()
BUG FIX: Loop due to sync of excerpt for post/article when saving (need to fix)
BUG FIX: Should return the articleID and not false if problems during save action in Article controller
BUG FIX: Didn't escape return values before displaying on front end
BUG FIX: Loaded all settings for Activities when all we need is ID and Post title (contributed to gateway timeout bug)
BUG FIX: Didn't include argument count for post_updated actions
BUG FIX: Too much overhead when loading Workouts (activities) on Activity editor page
BUG FIX: Caused loop when saving/updating a linked post for an article
BUG FIX: Don't have both save_post and update_post action that triggers same functionality
